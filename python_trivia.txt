File formats
If you want to open a file to read from and write to a file, without an error being produced /if the file does not yet exist, what file mode do you choose?
“w”
“r”
“w+”
“a”
3
“w+” allows you to read from a file, write to a file, and won’t throw an error if the file /doesn’t exist. Instead, it will create a new file.

Text positions
In example_file.txt, you have written “Line 1 goes here.”. You input example_file.read(3) /and return. You then input example_file.(5). What does IDLE spit out in interactive mode?
“Line “
“Lin”
“here.”
“e 1 g”

.read() functions like a bookmark. If you run the method once, then run it again with a /different number, it will pick up where the first number left off.

Reading lines
What does .readline() return?
All text in the file
A list of strings containing each line in the file
All text on the current line as a string
All text on the current line in a tuple

.readline() only returns text on the current line in the form of a string

S or no s?
What does .readlines() return?
All text in the file
A list of strings containing each line in the file
All text on the current line as a string
All text on the current line in a tuple

.readlines() returns a list, which is incredibly useful.

Number of lines
You’re working with file, write_it.txt. How do you print the number/ of lines write_it.txt has?
lines = write_it.readlines(); print len(lines)
lines = write_it.readline(); print len(lines)
count = 0; for line in write_it.txt: if line: count += 1; print count
